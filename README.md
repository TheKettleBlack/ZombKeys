# ZombKeys
A zombie killing typing game.
Requires PyGame and Python.
Type the word above the zombie's head, and hit enter or space to shoot a zombie and kill it. If a zombie reaches your fortification before you've killed it, it will damage your fortification for a number of points equal to the number of letters in the word. If your fortification health reaches zero, it's game over.
